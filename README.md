# Rock Paper Scissors - Odin Project

This is a Rock Paper Scissors game project completed as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It demonstrates my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

The Rock Paper Scissors game allows players to compete against the computer by selecting their choice of rock, paper, or scissors. The game follows the classic rules, where rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beat paper.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Reflection

This project provided an opportunity to apply the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills I have learned during The Odin Project curriculum. It allowed me to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic. I encountered challenges along the way, such as styling the interface and implementing the winner announcement, but I was able to overcome them through research and problem-solving.
